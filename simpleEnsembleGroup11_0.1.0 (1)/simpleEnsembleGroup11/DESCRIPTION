Description: package designed for the analysis of both binary and continuous response
    variables using a variety of regression techniques and machine learning models. 
    This package efficiently handles scenarios where the number of predictors is much larger 
    than the number of observations and includes advanced methods such as bagging and ensemble 
    learning to improve model accuracy and robustness.
